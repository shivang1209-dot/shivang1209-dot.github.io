### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or machine to mimic human-like behavior. For example:  
- Mimicking visual senses  
- Speech recognition  
- Decision-making  
- Natural language understanding  

AI is not a technology by itself but a goal set by technologists to imitate human intelligence.

### **What is Data Science?**  
Data science is an interdisciplinary field aimed at achieving AI. It primarily uses **machine learning** and **statistics techniques**. In most cases, **data scientists** are experts responsible for solving AI-related problems.  

---

### **What is Machine Learning?**  
Machine learning is a technique where a machine sifts through enormous amounts of data to find patterns.  
- This technique is frequently used for AI purposes.  
- Machine learning uses algorithms to train a machine to learn patterns based on differentiating features about the data.  
- The more training data, the more accurate the predictions.  

---

### **What is Deep Learning?**  
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.  
- It imitates how the human brain processes information through a **connected artificial neural network**.  
- Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning can discover **complex patterns** and differentiating features about the data **independently**.

### **Everyday AI**  
Numerous AI capabilities are already integrated into everyday applications, addressing realities such as:  
- Virtual communication  
- Managing overwhelming amounts of information  

These capabilities are present across almost every job and function.

### **Characteristics That Foster an AI-Driven Culture**  
A successful AI strategy addresses cultural and business issues. Fostering an AI-driven culture requires:  
1. **Being data-driven**  
2. **Empowering people**  
3. **Creating a responsible approach to AI**  

#### 1. **Data-Driven**  
- AI systems rely on **high-quality** and **complete data**.  
- Organizations need access to their entire **data estate** for reasoning.  

#### 2. **Data Access**  
- Most organizations generate and use data in silos.  
- Unified data provides better visibility for operational efficiency.  

#### 3. **Data Integrity**  
- Errors like inaccurate, irrelevant, or duplicate data reduce effectiveness.  
- Quality and integrity are critical to prevent errors.  

#### 4. **Empowered**  
Empowering employees enables cross-functional collaboration for AI transformation.  

#### 5. **Responsible**  
As AI evolves, it poses complex societal and ethical challenges. A **responsible approach** ensures AI aligns with desired futures.

### **AI Systems for Governance**  
To implement governance for AI, organizations can:  

#### **1. Make Resources Available**  
   ![Person Reading Manual](/assets/images/Personatdesk.jpg) 
- Employees need guidance (e.g., handbooks, manuals, training sessions) to incorporate **responsible AI principles**.  

#### **2. Create a Centralized AI Inventory**  
   ![Person Near Whiteboard](/assets/images/Personatoffice.jpg)
- Maintain a list of all AI models/systems in use.  
- Helps prioritize efforts and optimize resources.  

#### **3. Develop Tools**

### **Scaling AI in Organizations**  
Adopting AI requires **significant investments** and a long-term perspective.  

---

### **What is Microsoft's Horizon-Based Framework?**  
Microsoft uses a **horizon-based framework** to evaluate and prioritize AI investments. This framework divides development into phases:  

#### **Horizon 1: Running (Operate and Optimize the Core Business)**  
- Focus: Automate or improve existing processes.  
- Example:  
  - A manufacturer using AI for quality checks could increase efficiency (e.g., inspecting 1,000 parts/hour vs. 100 manually).  

#### **Horizon 2: Growing (Improve Market Position)**  
- Focus: Create new services or customer experiences.  
- Example:  
  - A manufacturer using IoT and AI to suggest **optimal maintenance schedules**.  

#### **Horizon 3: Transforming (Change Market Position)**  
- Focus: Revolutionize business models and create new markets.  
- Example:  
  - Developing innovative AI solutions that cross industry boundaries or create new customer needs.
