## **Challenge Name: Whisper Of The Pain**

### **Solves**

- **Solves:** 2
- **Points:** 300

### **Description**

The Valorant gaming community has recently become the target of a mysterious cyber campaign. This operation appears to exploit players who use cheating tools, turning their machines into unwitting pawns in a larger scheme.

Our investigation has led us to the computer of one such victim—a treasure trove of evidence awaits. Your mission is to dive deep, uncover the truth, and pinpoint the IP addresses used by the perpetrators to orchestrate this campaign. However, the analysis of the malicious samples has triggered the attackers. As a result, most of the links to the malicious code have now been taken down. Does this make it more difficult for you?

Download the artifact [here](Resources/2025-01-17T040003_Evidence.zip). Follow the investigation to it's end and you will uncover the flag.
